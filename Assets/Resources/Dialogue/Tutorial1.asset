  - So you want to learn how to play?
  - I think I can help with that.
  - For starters place a card anywhere on the board.
  - Your top row is where cards can attack and be attacked.
  - And your bottom row is a mostly safe place where creatures go to hide.
  - If you click on a card it switches betwen the two.
  - Try moving your cards around by clicking it a few times.
  - Now move your card to the combat row.
  - Now click the end turn button to start the combat phase.
  - As you can see in the top right corner your card damaged the enemy.
  - If you look in the bottom left corner you can see your energy bar.
  - All cards have a certain energy cost that you can see at the top right of every
    cards.
  - Try playing another card. You can play it in the same column if you want.
  - End your turn.
  - Well that was bound to happen.
  - Now that your enemy has played some cards its time to explain how death works
    in this world.
  - "When a card \"dies\" it gets injured. The type of injury depends on the damage
    type of the card that killed it. \nThat injury can be seen on the bottom right
    of the card."
  - You can see the damage type in the bottom left corner of a card under the damage
    number.
  - If a card "dies" of the same damage type twice it is repleced by a "Lost Soul"
    permanently.
  - And you might be asking yourself what a "lOsT sOuL" is and since its my job to
    explain such things i quess you will have to read even more text.
  - Lost soul is a single use card that is played on top of other cards to remove
    all of their injuries.
  - Well that was simple wasn't it?
  - Now try to kill off one of your cards.
