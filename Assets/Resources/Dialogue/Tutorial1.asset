  - So you want to learn how to play?
  - I think I can help with that.
  - For starters place a card anywhere on the board.
  - Your top row is where cards can attack and be attacked.
  - And your bottom row is a mostly safe place where creatures go to hide.
  - If you click on a card it switches betwen the two.
  - Try moving your cards around by clicking it a few times.
  - Now place it in the combat row and click the end turn button.
  - Now click the end turn button.
  - As you can see your card attacked the enemy directly.
