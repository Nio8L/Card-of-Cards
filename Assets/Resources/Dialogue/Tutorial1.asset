  - So you want to learn how to play?
  - I think I can help with that.
  - For starters place a card anywhere on the board.
  - Your top row is where cards can attack and be attacked.
  - And your bottom row is a mostly safe place where creatures go to hide.
  - If you click on a card it switches between the two.
  - Try moving your cards around by clicking it a few times.
  - Now move your card to the combat row.
  - Now click the end turn button to start the combat phase.
  - As you can see in the top right corner your card damaged the enemy.
  - If you look in the bottom left corner you can see your energy bar.
  - All cards have a certain energy cost that you can see at the top right of every
    cards.
  - Try playing another card. You can play it in the same column if you want.
  - End your turn.
  - Well that was bound to happen.
  - Now that your enemy has played some cards its time to explain how death works
    in this world.
  - "When a card \"dies\" it gets injured. That injury can be seen on the bottom
    right of the card. The type of injury depends on the damage type of the card
    that killed it. \n"
  - 'You can see the damage type in the bottom left corner of a card under the damage
    number. There are three types: scrach, bite and poison.'
  - If a card "dies" of the same damage type twice it is replaced by a "Lost Soul"
    permanently.
  - And you might be asking yourself what a "lOsT sOuL" is and since its my job to
    explain such things i guess you will have to read even more text.
  - Lost soul is a single use card that is played on top of other cards to remove
    all of their injuries.
  - Well that was simple wasn't it?
  - Now try to kill off one of your cards.
  - Congratulations! You just got your first lost soul!
  - Lost souls are really useful but they are pretty risky to get.
  - You still have to win the fight so i am going to give you some powerful cards
    that have sigils.
  - Sigils are useful abilities that change how a card plays.
  - You can hover over their icons to see what they do.
  - 'One thing you must know is that when a cards gets injured it gains a bleed sigil. '
  - When there is not enough space to add another one it removes a sigil
  - But you can remove bleed sigils by using a lost soul.
  - One last thing. Some sigils are active and can be used by right clicking them
    and then right clicking a slot.
  - You can see when you can use them by checking if there is a red star next to
    the sigil icon.
  - Now that you know everything about how to fight you can go ahead and finish the
    fight!
